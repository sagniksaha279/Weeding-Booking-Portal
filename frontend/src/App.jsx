// 1. Define the Root Route
const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-brand-light selection:bg-brand selection:text-white flex flex-col">
      <Navbar />
      <main className="w-full flex-grow">
        <Outlet />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  ),
});

// 2. Define All Individual Routes
const indexRoute = createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: "/", component: Home });
const servicesRoute = createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: "/services", component: Services });
const plansRoute = createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: "/plans", component: Plans });
const portfolioRoute = createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: "/portfolio", component: Portfolio });
const reviewsRoute = createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: "/reviews", component: Reviews });

// Core Functional Routes

  aboutRoute,
  contactRoute,
  vendorsRoute,
  vendorDetailsRoute,

  signupRoute,
  dashboardRoute,
  enquiriesRoute,
  bookingsRoute,
  profileRoute,
  paymentsRoute,

  notificationsRoute,
  bookingRoute,
  adminRoute
]);

// 4. Initialize the Router
const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

export default function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}
